## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Free Tier Testing
- Use ScreenshotOne's free tier (100 screenshots/month)
- Implement caching to minimize API calls
- Test with all portfolio websites

### Phase 2: Hybrid Approach
- Try iframe embedding first (free)
- Fallback to ScreenshotOne API if iframe blocked
- Cache screenshots locally to avoid repeated API calls

### Phase 3: Production Scaling
- Monitor usage and upgrade to paid plan if needed
- Implement error handling and fallback strategies
- Add user feedback mechanisms

## Technical Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- Cache screenshots in localStorage/sessionStorage
- Set reasonable expiration times (24-48 hours)
- Clear cache when storage limits reached

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback to placeholder images
- Retry logic for failed API calls
- User-friendly error messages

### Performance
- Lazy load screenshots
- Optimize image sizes
- Use WebP format when supported

## Cost Analysis

For a portfolio with 20 websites:
- **Development/Testing**: Free tier sufficient (100 screenshots)
- **Production**: Basic plan ($17/month) provides 2,000 screenshots
- **With caching**: Each site screenshot once = 20 API calls
- **Buffer for updates**: Plenty of room for growth

## Next Steps

1. Create test environment
2. Implement ScreenshotOne integration
3. Test with real portfolio websites
4. Develop hybrid iframe/screenshot system
5. Implement caching and error handling
